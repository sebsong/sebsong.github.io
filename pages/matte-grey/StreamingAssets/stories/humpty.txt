You know once upon a time I was a well loved king and I was SOOO beautiful. My skin a beautiful paper white...snow white... bird poop white. I was a beautiful egg shape too. The finest egg shape you could get. Everyone loved my curves...Everyone loved me! Even the children! I saw them one day outside with the red cloaked woman. She was so beautiful, you know? Almost TOO beautiful, but in the kindness of my heart I took her into the deep dungeons with the children... you know for that... protection? We
can't have too many beautiful people sharing the same sun-space, you know? They were SO grateful when I locked them under there! I mean WHO WOULDN'T. I promised to protect them with my BEAUTY. Then one day while I was on the roof admiring how DARN BEAUTIFUL I AM COMPARED TO EVERYONE ELSE. I saw a furry creature. A furry creature ...LIKE YOU, who broke through my walls... and I FELL. You WRETCHED BEAST. BROKE MY WALLS, BROKE MY FACE, AND BROKE MY HEART. You will pay... mark my words you will pay...
