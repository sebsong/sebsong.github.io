Hey diddle diddle
The cat and the fiddle
The cow jumped over the moon
The little dog laughed to see such sport
And the dish ran away with the spoon.


Once upon a time
I had lived with a guy named Spoon.
Things were good between us but soon...
Spoon became different.
He didn't really want me for me.

It was then I met Cow.
"Hey Diddle Diddle!"
He said to me
And he was great
He always respected me
He believed I was able to do things 
Things that I didn't even believe, myself.
While Spoon on the other hand
said that my greatest asset 
was still my worst
It hurt
With the constant support that cow gave
I found myself having feelings for cow

Now tell me. 
Is it wrong that I left spoon?

I wanted something new.
I wanted a future with cow.
Cat was there by my side
Encouraging me to follow cow
She said its a different melody to sing to
While that little dog on the other hand
laughed at the idea
But I decided

After I left spoon
I felt something that I had lost long ago...
Happiness.
I felt that cow and I...
Had something
I know I loved him
And his quirkiness 
But something inside was afraid
Afraid of the fact that I felt
He was going away...
Far away to a place 
that would be difficult to follow
But I think I realized
that he was reaching for the stars
The stars that terrified me
The future
Those aspirations 
I was afraid I wouldn't live up to.
I was afraid I wouldn't be good enough
For him,
Or his way of living 
I didn't think I was worth his time.
I'd just be a disappointment 

So when the time came
He looked to me softly
With those eyes of gentle encouragement
I felt he wanted me to follow him
"it's okay" those eyes said
But I didn't want him to believe it was okay
To believe that I was worthy to follow him
Or even be equal with him for the rest of my life
Because I didn't think I was worth that much
So I told myself 
"he doesn't want to travel his life with you"
"don't expect something unreasonable"
"he's going. Don't be difficult
"stay in the comfort of known security"
I felt I needed to end everything 
So I told cow
"I don't think I want to see the stars.
I'd be crazy 
if I thought that the outside world 
Could give me more out of life"
In other words
Don't love me
It's a waste of your time
And I won't love you
Because you will not feel the same
And so he looked at me
With those eyes that even today
I can't fully understand.
It read disappointment. 
Not at me.
But at the idea of us.
Our future
He smiled 
And for the rest of his days on earth
He would prepare to leave...
I tried not to be difficult...
I tried not to tell him how I felt
Then the day came
He reached the stars
And never looked back 
Cow jumped over the moon.

And i settled.

For the one who loved me when convenient 
And i ran away with Spoon 
to the village just north of this sad forest
Spoon, who thought I was just okay
