01Jack and 02Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water.
01Jack fell down and broke his crown,
And 02Jill came tumbling after.
Up 01Jack got, and home did trot,
As fast as he could caper,
To old Dame Dob, who patched his nob
With vinegar and brown paper.
I'm a little teapot, 

Short and stout, 

Here is my handle, 

Here is my spout, 

When I get all steamed up, 

Hear me shout, 

Tip me up and pour me out!

I'm a clever teapot, 

Yes, it's true, 

Here's an example of what I can do, 

I can turn my handle into a spout, 

Tip me over and pour me out!
