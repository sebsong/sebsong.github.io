One day I met a wonderful person named Cow. "Hey Diddle Diddle!" He would say to me. He believed I was able to do things Things that I didn't even believe, myself. I wanted a future with cow. Cat was there by my side.Pushing me to follow Cow. She said it would be a different melody to sing to. While that little dog on the other hand laughed at the idea But something inside was afraid Afraid of the fact that I felt He was going away... Far away to a place  that would be difficult to follow He was reaching for the stars The stars that terrified me The future Those aspirations I was afraid I wouldn't live up to. I was afraid I wouldn't be good enough For him, Or his way of living I didn't think I was worth his time. I'd just be a disappointment 

So when the time came He looked to me softly With those eyes of gentle encouragement I felt he wanted me to follow him "it's okay" those eyes said but I told cow
"I don't think I want to see the stars.
I'd be crazy 
if I thought that the outside world 
Could give me more out of life"

And so he looked at me With those eyes that even today I can't fully understand. It read disappointment.  Not at me. But at the idea of us. Our future Then the day came He reached the stars And never looked back Cow jumped over the moon.

And I settled.  I ran away with Spoon
