Ants like you don't deserve to live. I'll bash your skulls in. I'll rip your insides out. Lance up. Strike down. Crush the ants. Break the bones. I feel nothing for your pain. Bleed inside. Bleed outside. Save your tears and die a painful death. Mash the bones, rip the insides until there is nothing left. Nothing but the sweet satisfaction of my enemies screams of agony. I will crush you.. Pierce the heart until nothing is left. You don't deserve a fate any better. Enemies of my kingdom. Cherish your last moments of agony. Lance up. Strike down. I'll fight. Lance up. Strike down. Now Die!
